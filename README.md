# Snappy Bolt Action Rifle Trigger
This mod replaces the trigger-threshold on all bolt action rifles so that they have the same trigger behavior as lever action firearms. 
As such, they fire whenever the momentary switch at the end of travel on the Index's Knuckle Controllers triggers is pressed, giving you a clean and crisp trigger pull.
